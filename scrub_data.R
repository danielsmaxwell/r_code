# In the same way we used brackets to subset vectors, we also use them to subset dataframes. However, vectors have only one direction, but dataframes have two. Therefore we have to use two values in the brackets: the first representing the row, and the second representing the column: `[[row, column]]`. 

# When using tibbles, single brackets will return a tibble, but double brackets will return the individual vectors or values without names.

# Subsetting a vector 
c("do", "re", "mi", "fa", "so") [1]

# Subsetting a data frame:
# Pull a single variable into a tibble with names
books[5, 2]

### Pull out a single variable without names
books[[5, 2]]

### Use names to pull data
books[[2, "title"]]

# Subsetting using brackets is important to understand, but as with other R functions, the `dplyr` package makes it much more straightforward, using the `filter()` function.

# Filter books to return only those items where the format is books
booksOnly <- filter(books, format == "book")

# Use multiple filter conditions, 
# e.g. books to include only books with more than zero checkouts
bookCheckouts <- filter(books,
                        format == "book",
                        tot_chkout > 0) 

### How many are there? 
nrow(bookCheckouts)

### What percentage of all books have at least one checkout?

### Run `unique(books$location)` and `unique(books$sub_collection)` to confirm the values in each of these fields.


### Create a new data frame filtering to keep format == books and tot_chkout > 20. Use the `table()` function to see the breakdown of booksOnly by `sub_collection`. Which sub-collection has the most items with 20 or more checkouts?


### Create a data frame consisting of `format` books and `sub_collection` juvenile materials. What is the average number of checkouts `tot_chkout` for juvenile books?

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Selecting variables
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `select()` function allows you to keep or remove specific variables. It also provides a convenient way to reorder variables.  Specify the variables you want to keep by name.
booksTitleCheckouts <- select(books, title, tot_chkout)

# Specify the variables you want to remove with a -
books <- select(books, -call_item)

# Reorder columns, combined with everything()
booksReordered <- select(books, title, tot_chkout, loutdate, everything())

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Arranging data 
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `arrange()` function in the `dplyr` package allows you to sort your data by alphabetical or numerical order. 

booksTitleArrange <- arrange(books, title)

# Use desc() to sort a variable in descending order
booksHighestChkout <- arrange(books, desc(tot_chkout))

# Order data based on multiple variables (e.g. sort first by checkout, then by publication year)
booksChkoutYear <- arrange(books, desc(tot_chkout), desc(pubyear))

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Creating new variables 
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `mutate()` function allows you to create new variables.

library(stringr)

# Use the str_sub() function from the stringr package to extract the first character of the callnumber variable (the LC Class)
booksLC <- mutate(books, lc_class = str_sub(callnumber, 1, 1))

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Pipe Operator] `%>%` is loaded with the `tidyverse`. It takes the output of one statement and makes it the input of the next statement. You can think of it as "then" in natural language.

myBooks <- books %>%
  filter(format == "book") %>%
  select(title, tot_chkout) %>%
  arrange(desc(tot_chkout))

# The SQL equivalent of the pipe code listed above is as follows:
#   select title, tot_chkout
#     from books
#    where format = 'book'
# order by tot_chkout desc

# Create a new data frame from books with these conditions:
# filter to include subCollection juvenile & k-12 materials and format books
# select only title, call number, total checkouts, and pub year
# arrange by total checkouts in descending order

# Create a new data frame from books with these conditions:
# rename call_item column to call_number
# filter out NA values in the call number column
# filter to include only books published after 1990
# arrange from oldest to newest publication year
