## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. In addition to R, you can embed a Python code chunk like this:

```{python, engine.path="/Users/danielmaxwell/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python35/python.exe"}

x = 'Hello, Python World!'

print(x.split(' '))

```
With Python, you need to set the engine.path variable.  RStudio documentation indicates that you can use the Python engine in a code snippet by referencing the interpreter like this: {python}.  However, this only works if python.exe is in the Windows PATH variable, in a location accessible to RStudio.  The path, of course, is unique to each computer.
